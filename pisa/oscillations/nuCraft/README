   nuCraft: Calculation of oscillation probabilities of atmospheric neutrinos   
================================================================================

Welcome to nuCraft!

NuCraft is a Python project for the calculation of neutrino oscillation
probabilities, with an emphasis on atmospheric neutrinos. For more detailed
information and the most recent version, check out the official homepage:
   
   http://nucraft.hepforge.org
   
As this is purely Python, installation is not necessary; you can just import
the project and get started.
Documentation can be found in the docstrings, with some additional explanations
in inline comments.
